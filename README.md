# nextword

Recreating Gmail's next word recommendations but for offline applications like vim and mutt.

## Goals:

Implement an extensible command line interface which:

* [ ] trains and saves models on the filesystem
* [ ] takes an input prompt of text
* [ ] predicts the next word or few words

See DESIGN.md for more on the route by which these are accomplished
